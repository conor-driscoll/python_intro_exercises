Lists are mutable while tuples are not, so therefore lists offer more flexibility, while tuples are less likely to be a source of bugs, especially in complex programs and systems with concurrent work occuring.

Lists and tuples are both ordered collections and they both can be made up of mutable or immutable objects.
